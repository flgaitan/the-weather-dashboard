# <The-Weather-dashboard>

## Description
In this project we are creating a functional weather dashboard displaying weather in different cities.

- What was your motivation?
The motivation for this project was to create a weather application that would fetch weather data from the weather API and to be able to successfull display that information on the page.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
This project was built as a way to get us comfortable working with API's and fetching date from the source. The challenge begins with displaying the information on the page and it only builds from there.

- What problem does it solve?
This project solves not knowing what the weather will be like. Let's say you're planning a trip and you want to pack your outfits accordingly, it is a great tool to have access to weather data to see current weather and weather days in advance, although weather conditions can always change.

- What did you learn?
I learned the most working with the API and successfully figuring out how to fetch its data. I also learned how to make an API key and use it successfully. I learned about the objects in the data that was fetched and how the right API can either provide you with all of what you need or can challenge you in terms on figuring out how to make it work for what you are trying to display to the user on the page. For example, this API only works in three hour increments for a fourday forecast, so figuring out when the day is over during those times periods it's a challenge of its own. I found that displaying that data is particularly challenging.
